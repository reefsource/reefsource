        <p>Our goal is to make image sourcing easy and fun. We want to replace boring note taking during dives and tedious data entry with modern image analysis.</p>

        <p>Once we receive the photos from you, we will run them through our computational pipeline. We start by detecting corals using computer vision
            classification algorithms. We then analyze coral colors and produce a histogram that is similar to the one Coral Watch uses.</p>

            Easy Five Steps For Photo Capture
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on the camera. Make sure that the camera is in the <strong>PHOTO</strong> mode, that <strong>RAW</strong> image capture is enabled and that the <strong>GPS</strong> is turned on (if you’ve used and adjusted the camera recently, these should already be set, however after longer periods of time when the camera is)</li>
            <li>Leave the camera on for a few minutes, until the GPS acquires satellite signal and calculates the position. At this point, the GPS status icon in the upper left corner of the camera will turn dark gray.</li>
            <li>Before you go underwater, but after the camera has acquired the GPS signal, please take a few (about 4 or 5) photos of the surroundings; the horizon, sky etc. We use those images to make note of the longitude and latitude (GPS does not work underwater), and to have a general idea about the illumination conditions (sunny, cloudy etc.)</li>
            <li>As backup, we recommend you to take notes of the following: <strong>Your Country > Your Surname > Dive Site >Date and Time</strong>.</li>
            <li>One thing to remember is to try capturing a representative sample of the underwater landscape, rather than just focus on beautiful sights. We are looking for a variety of images for sampling purposes, both close-ups and wide-angle shots. <strong>A bird’s eye view of corals from about 1m will work best.</strong></li>
